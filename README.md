Airbnb is known as an online platform enabling people to rent or lease lodgings for a short term. Established in 2008, Airbnb now has over 150 million of users worldwide. Boston, known for its inhospitable rents pricing and hotel prices, is growing into a popular place for Airbnb hosts.


For this project, I am interested in studying the effects of geographies, satisfactory ratings and violent crime rates on the pricing of Airbnb listings. Also, I am interested in the effects on ratings of Airbnb listings. The goal for this project is to understand what are the issues affecting clients satisfactory ratings and pricing for Airbnb listings in Boston.


In this study, I am hoping to answer the below questions:
              1. Does geographies of the listings affect ratings? What about crime rates?
              2. Do higher prices tend to have higher ratings?
              3. To obtain high ratings(over 4 points), what are the requirements of the listing?
              4. Are the ratings effective in indicating different levels of listed features?
